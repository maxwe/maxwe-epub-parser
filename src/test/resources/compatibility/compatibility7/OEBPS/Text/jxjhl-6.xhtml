    <p class="text-time">In the 21st century, with the rise of the worldwide wave of neo-technology revolution and intelligence economy, education has increasingly become a determining factor in a country’s development and its international competition.International organizations and governments of different countries have paid close attention to education as primary issues that humans meet in the challenges of the new century.Many countries have thus brought forward various strategic countermeasures and policies at the state level.Such a trend indicates that education will play a more and more important role in the development of economy and society, while education itself will experience an unprecedented profound change and innovation.In a new century and a new period, with a new historical mission and a new grand objective that we shall comprehensively build a well-to-do society and construct a harmonious society as well as a great power of human resource, the government,the education system and all of the educators are faced with an arduous important task of completely changing the situation of low-level, non-comprehensive and unequal education and exploitation of human resources, and producing hundreds of millions of quality workers, tens of millions of people with professional skills, and a great batch of creative talents so as to further meet the need of the broad masses of the people who should receive quality and efficient education and their wishes that they could enjoy fair and equal education.This is also a historical as well as realistic educational project that we encounter.</p>

    <p class="text-time">The equalizing development of education is both a novel notion and an original view, which has been proposed at present and aroused the close attention and concern by the people for historical, realistic, and contemporary social reasons.The idea of equalizing development of education is a reflection of the educational reality in our country, a reconsideration of the current educational system, an ideal for educational development as well as an urgent need for fundamental educational reform in the new period.It is a tide of the worldwide educational development, a new notion of modern education, an essential requirement of the socialist educational cause as well as a strategic problem proposed to us by history and reality which urgently needs to be solved.That is, after the popularization of fundamental education, especially compulsory education, era of universal access to fundamental education especially compulsory education, senior middle school education will begin to be largely popularized.What road will China take in its development of fundamental education in the time when compulsory education, especially fundamental education, is popularized? What are the orientation, goal and path in China’s development of fundamental education? This is an essential question as well as a strategic task China’s education faces in the new period.Therefore, the equalizing development of fundamental education is China’s historical choice in the face of a new century and a new period with new tasks as well as its inexorable choice for the development of fundamental education.</p>

    <p class="text-time">Fundamental education is a cornerstone in improvement of the quality of all citizens, implementation of the strategy of rejuvenating the country through science and education as well as the construction of a harmonious society.The promotion of equalizing development of fundamental education is not only the essential requirements of socialist education, the inexorable demands for the comprehensive building of a well-to-do society as well as a strategic task to benefit all the people.The equalizing development of fundamental education is not only the major issue concerning national strategies, but also the requirement to build up the concept of scientific development and implement the man-oriented governing strategy.The promotion of equalizing development of education is of great strategic and realistic significance for the comprehensively building of a well-to-do society and the construction of a harmonious society in the new era； for the establishment and implementation of concept of scientific development of education； for the advance of sustainable and healthy development of China’s education, especially fundamental education； for the containment of the current unreasonable and unequal development of fundamental education； for the optimization of allocation with educational resources and the comprehensive implementation of quality education； for the alleviation of contradictions between fairness and effectiveness and the maintenance of social stability； for the regional harmonious and equal development of economy and society and for the realization of our country’s grand goal of modernizations.</p>

    <p class="text-time">What this book studies, therefore, is a reflection of our country’s current educational problems, a review and reconsideration of its current educational system, and a forward-looking research on the developmental trend for the future education； it is the need for the comprehensive building of a well-to-do society and the construction of a harmonious society, a tide of the worldwide educational development as well as the latest trend in the development of modern education.</p>

    <p class="text-time">On the basis of China’s current national conditions, at the height of comprehensively building up a well-to-do society and constructing a harmonious society, from the historical perspective of the relationship between education and economy, education and society, education and comprehensive development of people, and the essential status and function of education in the development of economy and society, with the great vision of overall promotion of quality education, this book is a theoretical study of the equalizing development of fundamental education, and attempts to establish a certain theoretical system and model so as to explore the theoretical basis and practical foundation for the fundamental education in the new period.This book is a positivist analysis of the equalizing development of fundamental education from the multi-angle, multi-level, wide-range perspective.The book is a case study based on certain schools selected from among the country to explore the new paths to promote the equalizing development of fundamental education.Through theoretical research and quantitative analysis, the book tries to establish the theoretical system, target system and measurement methods of equalizing development of education.Then through the positivist study of regional equalizing development of education and a large number of investigations of school education, by analysis, expounding and proof, the book attempts to explore new ways and action strategy of balanced development of education of China’s equalizing development of fundamental education in 21st century.</p>

    <p class="text-time">The book consists of seven parts.Part I, background and significance (Chapter 1) describes the background of the equalizing development of education, and the significance and ideas of this study.Through literature review, this chapter analyzes the status quo of the research on the equalizing development of education at home and abroad.Part II theoretical deduction (Chapters 2, 3, 4) analyzes the properties of education and the conditions of equal education from the economic perspective, illustrates the features, ways and means of allocating educational resources, answers the questions of what notion the equal education is and why education needs equality.These chapters expound the function of the equalizing development of education in economy and society on the positive side and the results of un-equalizing development of education on the negative side, with the emphasis on the theoretical analysis of the equalizing development of education.These chapters are a comprehensive account of the theory of the equalizing development of education, with a scientific expounding of the notion of equal education and the equalizing development of education, thus constructing a basic theoretical framework.In this part, the theory of the four phases of the equalizing development of fundamental education is proposed, with the emphasis on the theoretical account of the equalizing development of education.Part III structuring the system (Chapter 5) establishes the target system and measuring methods of the equalizing development of education and creates its indexical system.Through the analysis of the data, the indexes and the trend of the equalizing development of fundamental education in China are worked out.Part IV Positivist analysis (Chapters 6,7) explores the manifestations, features, characteristics and causes of the un-equalizing development of fundamental education through positivist analysis and investigations of the status quo in regions, urban and rural areas, schools and social groups, focusing on the positivist analysis of the status quo in China.Part V case studies (Chapter 8) attempts to find certain models with Chinese characteristics on promoting the equalizing development of fundamental education among different regions.To achieve the goal, this chapter sums up the progress made on the equalizing development of education around the world and studies the cases in six typical regions in the eastern, middle, and western parts of china, namely, Shenzhen City, Hangzhou City, Shouguang City, Tongling City, Chengdu City and Shenyang City, with the focus on the case studies.Part VI action strategies (Chapter 9) presents the paths and countermeasures of the equalizing development of fundamental education through theoretical study, measurement study and positivist study, focusing on the countermeasures to explore the action strategies that will suit the situation in the early 21st century in China.Part VII the highlights of the study (Chapter 10) is a comprehensive and systematic summary, refinement and highlight of the theoretical viewpoints and practical explorations in the book, stressing the rich implications of the man-oriented equalizing development of education as well as the system and thinking of the theory and indexes of equalizing development of education.</p>

    <p class="text-time">In the specific research methods, this book combines qualitative analysis with quantitative analysis, static analysis with dynamic analysis, macroeconomic analysis with meso- and micro-analysis, fieldwork with statistical methods, theoretical study with positivist analysis, measurement analysis with case studies, etc.This book identifies the relationship between the relevant factors concerning the equal education through qualitative analysis, and reveals the volume changes among the above factors through studies by modern mathematical methods.In other words, this is an integrated research combining qualitative research on the basis of information in text along with quantitative research on the basis of information in data.The book aims to find the characteristics, status quo and size of the equalizing development of education through the static analysis of the situation of the equalizing development of education at a certain time or within a certain space, and also to observe the trend, direction and natural law of the equalizing development of education through dynamic analysis of the equalizing development of education and its motion and change in a certain period of history.Through macro-, meso- and micro-analyses, the book studies the issues of the equalizing development of education from the strategy of national development and the development of national economy and society, from regions, urban and rural areas, interschool and inter-group, and from schools, the specific units of education.The book tries to find the intrinsic links and developmental law among the factors of the equalizing development of education through surveys, statistical data collection of original materials and positivist analysis.On the basis of theoretical positivist studies of some regions where the equalizing development of fundamental education prevails, the book explores its regional patterns and strategies in our country.</p>

    <p class="text-time">The fundamental path of the study in this book is to integrate the review of literature, comparative study between China and other countries, comprehensive analysis, investigations, theoretical research, measurement and case studies, so as to present countermeasures and action strategies on the equalizing development of fundamental education and ultimately promote educational equality.</p>

    <p class="text-time">The equalizing development of fundamental education not only reflects a new realm of the development of modern education but also an orientation for the development of future education.The greatest technical difficulty of the study lies in its theoretical description, the establishment of an equalizing model, the set-up of its target system and index system as well as the analysis on the degree of educational equality.The creativity of the book are： First, this book has attempted to systematically study the equalizing development of fundamental education in China from the historical and realistic development of Chinese economy, society and education, as well as from the strategic height of comprehensively building a well-to-do society and constructing a harmonious society, from the perspective of educational economics, therefore, the book has its creativity.Second, the book takes equal education as the basis for balanced economy and the prerequisite for balanced development of society, which is a notional and educational creativity.By using the principle of economics and economic theory to combine theory with positivism and case studies, the book has its methodological creativity.Third, this book, for the first time, has probed into the profound theory and scientifically expounded the implications of the equalizing development of education from the macro-, meso- and micro-dimensions and the analysis of 15 content indicators, with a proposal of an insightful theory and a clarification of the way of theoretical researches and a construction of its theoretical system.Fourth, the book has expounded the thought of the equalizing development of education, set forth its fundamental framework and presented a four-phase theory.Fifth, for the first time, the book has introduced the concept of the balance degree in economics into the research on equal education, and has systematically analyzed its trend with quantitative analysis and found its general trend in China.Sixth, for the first time, the book introduces index to the analysis of the equalizing development of education, and further established the index system and detailed index for its research.The book has launched a quantitative analysis and measurement study with 25 indicators at four levels and found the general trend on the index of the equalizing development of China’s fundamental education.In this sense, the study is of great theoretical and practical significance and can work as a guide for policy-making.</p>

    <p class="text-time">The book is not only a theoretical thinking but also an exploration into practice.Its study and indexes is of great theoretical and practical significance both to the scientific research on education and to the timely monitoring of the status quo of education as well as the making of educational policies.The important theoretical and practical value of the book lies in its realistic application and its guidance to the development of education.The theoretical value of the book is as follows： It has established a theoretical framework for the equalizing development of education, comprehensively explained its implication, and presented the phase theory and the developmental notion the equalizing development education should establish.The practical value of the book is as follows： It has constructed its indexes and given a possibly accurate description of its situation and trend which can work as a warning to the government in its policy-making and, when necessary, the government should take certain measures to control the indexes within certain ranges.The important developmental prospects of the study are that the fundamental situations and trends of balanced development of education in a certain country or region can be reflected directly with these indexes.At the same time, according to the phase theory, the book has found the “boundary” between low, medium and high levels with the international comparative method, which can directly reflect the different phases which different countries or regions are at, so as to appraise these countries’ or regions’ status of and progress in the equalizing development of education.</p>
